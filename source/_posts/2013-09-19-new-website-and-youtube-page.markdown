Most people who are here for the Minecraft mods are not interested in programming (but if you are, kudos to you, and if you [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/IQAndreas) I may have something in store for you in the near future). So, I have separated this part of the site off from [my regular programming blog](http://blog.iqandreas.com/), and have done the same for my YouTube account.

So, if you are interested in following the progress on any of my mods, or want to be notified when new mods or patches are out, you can follow us on any of the following media:

* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/IQAndreas-MineCraft-Mods-and-Patches/277929005624242)
* [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/IQAndreasMinecraft)

I also still have [my old faithful Twitter account](https://twitter.com/IQAndreas) which is geared more towards other developers, but if there is enough interest, let me know and I will create a separate Twitter account just for my Minecraft mods.

Now, let's get [some of my old mods](http://blog.iqandreas.com/minecraft/) updated to 1.6.2 and beyond.
