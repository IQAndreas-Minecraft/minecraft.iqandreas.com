    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Why use three command blocks, when one would suffice?</em></p>

<p>For a developer, the standard <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> operators would be pure gold. This would also require commands to have return values or exit codes, which is simple enough to implement as well.</p>

<p>This would allow multiple commands to be run from the same command block, which for example would allow you to use a testfor and the target command in a more compact way.</p>

<p>In the same category is the &ldquo;end of line&rdquo; character (represented by <code>;</code> in every object oriented language that I can think of) which would allow the additional commands to be executed regardless of whether or not the previous command was successful.</p>

<p>This time, rather than create a mod for the features I want, I added the suggestions to Reddit (so if you use Reddit, show them some love):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1lyqeo/logical_operators_in_commands_and_command_blocks/">Logical operators in commands (and command blocks)</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1n5xdb/chain_multiple_commands_in_the_same_command_block/">Chain multiple commands in the same command block</a></strong></li>
</ul>
